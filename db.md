# ðŸŽ¯ Usage Examples

## Typical Queries

**Get all subjects for a student in current academic year:**
```sql
SELECT s.* FROM subjects s
JOIN student_subjects ss ON s.id = ss.subject_id
WHERE ss.student_id = ? AND ss.academic_year_id = ?
```

**Get all permissions for a user (via roles + direct):**
```sql
-- Via roles
SELECT DISTINCT p.* FROM permissions p
JOIN role_permissions rp ON p.id = rp.permission_id
JOIN roles r ON rp.role_id = r.id
JOIN user_roles ur ON r.id = ur.role_id
WHERE ur.user_id = ?

UNION

-- Direct permissions
SELECT p.* FROM permissions p
JOIN user_permissions up ON p.id = up.permission_id
WHERE up.user_id = ?
```

**Get quiz results for a student:**
```sql
SELECT q.title, qa.score, qa.created_at
FROM quiz_attempts qa
JOIN quizzes q ON qa.quiz_id = q.id
WHERE qa.student_id = ?
ORDER BY qa.created_at DESC
```
